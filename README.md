# Tech Blog

## Description
This is a full-stack web application that allows users to create their own tech-related blog posts for everyone to see. The homepage consists of all of the blog posts that have been made on the website. When you click on a blog post, you are taken to a page for that post specifically and given the option to comment on the post if you are logged in. If you are logged in, you also have the option to view your own dashboard, which contains all of your previous blog posts and the options to update and delete them.
